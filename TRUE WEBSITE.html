                        <p><h3 class="section-title"><u>The Problem and Need</u></h3>
            <p>• A typical school will use an average of 2,000 sheets per day, <br>meaning that during a full school year of 160 days, a school will chew through over 320,000 sheets of paper per year.<br><br>
• With roughly 14,89,115 schools in India, this means that all together schools are consuming as much as 4,76,51,68,00,000 sheets of paper per year, and that is a very very big number.</p><br><br>

            <p>• In a world where paper waste and environmental concerns are growing, affordability becomes a significant need within Indian communities.</p>

            <p>• Many individuals within these communities are actively seeking unique, environmentally conscious yet budget-friendly solutions for their everyday needs.</p>
        <h3 class="section-title"><u>Our Innovative Solution</u></h3>

        <p>•	Recycling 1 tonne of paper saves around 1400 liters of oil, 26,500 liters of water and 17 trees.<br>
•	Paper accounts for around 26% of landfill waste and 33% of municipal waste.<br><br>
• Our idea aims to address this pressing need by repurposing old notebook pages into affordable notebooks.</p>

        <p>• This offers an innovative, sustainable solution that aligns with the values and budget constraints of Indian minority consumers.</p>
        <h3 class="section-title"><u>Our Mission and Values</u></h3>

        <p>• At our core, we are driven by a dual mission - to reduce paper waste and make quality notebooks accessible to all.</p>

        <p>• We believe in the power of repurposing, turning what might have been discarded into valuable tools for learning and creativity.</p>

        <p>• Our commitment to sustainability goes beyond just our products. We source materials responsibly, ensuring that every aspect of our business aligns with eco-conscious practices.<br><br>
            •With every purchase, our customers become a part of a movement that not only saves money but also contributes to a more sustainable future for all..</p>
